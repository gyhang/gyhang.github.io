<h1>2-14 Do you speak English</h1>

<div>   
<p>I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town. One the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!</p>
