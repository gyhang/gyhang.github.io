<h1>2-03 Please send me a card</h1>

<div>  
<p>Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in pulic gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he let me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a wod.</p>
<p>Everyday I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room. but I did not write a single card!</p>
