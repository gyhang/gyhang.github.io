<h1>2-02 Breakfast or lunch?</h1>

<div>  
<p>It was Sunday. I never getup early on Sundays. I somtimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.' </p>
<p>'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.</p>
<p>'What are you doing?' she asked.</p>
<p>'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated. </p>
<p>'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'</p>
